# PyHarm

**Polyharmonic spline interpolation in PyTorch**

---

PyHarm is a PyTorch module designed for efficient [polyharmonic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyharmonic_spline). Leveraging GPU acceleration, this implementation excels in performance, making it well-suited for large-scale interpolation tasks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyharm
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command with the test option to execute regression tests:

```bash
pip install --install-option test
```

The only dependencies are PyTorch and NumPy.
