### Polyharmonic spline interpolation in PyTorch

---

This is a PyTorch module for [polyharmonic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyharmonic_spline). This implementation benefits from GPU acceleration, making it significantly faster and more suitable for larger interpolation problems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyharm
```

or

```bash
pip install --install-option test
```

to runthe regression tests.
The only dependencies are PyTorch and NumPy.
